A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 
In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. 
Every value in Python has a datatype


Last tutorial Python Data types

int
float/double
boolean
strings

Reminder na hindi kinikilala ng python ang char data type
cino-consider niya na to be a str (string) data type WITH A LENGTH OF ONE :) 

Again you can watch it in my previous tutorial which is Python tutorial #9

'''

'''
number = 10
number_float = 10.001
boolean_data=True
word = "Hello World"


print(type(number))
print(type(number_float))
print(type(boolean_data))
print(type(word))
'''

#int number = 10;
#number = "Hello";


#Don't ever put a semicolon in declaring/initializing variables guys! hahaha

'''
number = 10
print(type(number))

number = "Hello"

print(type(number))
